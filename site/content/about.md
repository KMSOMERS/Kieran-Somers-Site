I'm Kieran, a mobile developer at Hillary Blinds focusing on Android development. 

I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to be using this site for, I have set it up as a place to blog about how I am joining the <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code">#100DaysOfCode</a> movement and as a place to post my progress but I will likely be using it to post about personal stuff as well. 

The goal is to make 2018 a year full of progress in both my professional and personal life and commiting to an hour a day of coding (outside of work) is a great start.
