Nearly 10% of the way there already! These posts for the next few weeks are going to be short as I am just going to be working on algorithms and coding questions. I really should havbe started this prep earlier but now is better than later. The current plan is to read through Programming Interviews Exposed while tacking problems on Leetcode/Hackerrank and then read and tackle the questions in Cracking the Coding interview.


<b>Today's Progress:</b> Read chapter 4 (linked lists) from the book Programming Interviews Exposed. Went over Linked list problems on Hackerrank (Completed 7 problems).

<b>Thoughts:</b> I am still reliant on code completion so it will be beneficial to start writing some of these problems down on a whiteboard soon. Linked lists aren't too bad because I am a Java developer so I don't have to deal with pointers. Remembering to return the head and setting the head to a temporary variable is the only 'hard' part I need to remember.
