Trying some programming challenges, I have realised that I need to spend some time gaining a better understanding of C# before diving into Xamarin so the next few days will be me following a course on C# and planning out the project.

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Started a course on C#.

<b>Thoughts:</b> Java and C# are very similar languages but the difference in styles and API's means that I need to spend more time learning how to write C# style code instead of relying on my current habits from Java.
