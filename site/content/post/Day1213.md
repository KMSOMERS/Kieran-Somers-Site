Didn't get a chance to post yesterday so today is going to be both day 12 and 13! Yesterday I was definitely feeling demotivated but I finished the SQL course at work and now I can say I have a decent understanding of how to query and extract data using SQL. Back onto trees today and the recursive nature of the challenges using them is starting to click.

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Tackled more Tree problems. Read chapter 6 - Arrays and String from Programming Interviews Exposed and worked on some String problems.

<b>Thoughts:</b> Practice, practice, practice - I definitely let my knowledge of algorithms and data structures slip after finishing university and I definitely won't let it happen again. For now I am just trying to go over all the topics in Programming Interviews Exposed to get a base understanding, before doing a deeper dive into each subject. Learning more and more every day though and I am feeling optimistic.
