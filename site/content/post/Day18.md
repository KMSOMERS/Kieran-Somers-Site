Today I spent some time looking over the Xamarin framework. Injured my wrist and after the interview yesterday I just wanted to have a quiet day. So here is todays progress. 

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Started learning the Xamarin framework.

<b>Thoughts:</b> I am very excited to learn something new and starting now means that moving into the new role will be easier.
