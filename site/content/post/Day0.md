Today is the prep for the <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge where I have created this site as a place for me to post my progress and make a commitment to finishing. 

The plan is to follow two pomodoro cycles (25 minutes on 5 minutes off) and then write a post about how much I got done within the hour, but this may change depending on how long the posts take to write. At the end of each week I will also be writing a more personal post on how the week went and what I am doing outside of programming to better myself. 

100 days seems like such a long amount of time but we are already in March so I am sure that the days are going to fly by. Recently I have been starting and stopping projects without finishing them so I am going to set a couple milestones for the challenge as something to work towards.

## The Commitment

*I have two Android projects that are in various stages of completion which I am going to finish during the 100 days.*
___

The first Android project is a Never Have I Ever drinking game that I originally started as stumbled upon the <a href="https://github.com/glomadrian/Grav"> Grav library</a>, I had just started to learn the MVP architecture pattern and it was an idea that meant I could implement both. It was nearly at the stage of completion, but looking back through the code I originally developed it without fully understanding the pattern so I am going to rewrite it to test my knowledge of the pattern now (AND WRITE TESTS!!). The app was originally written in Java so for this project I will be sticking with it.

Goals for this project:

    - Check that my current understanding of the MVP pattern is correct.
    - To publish my first app to the play store.
    - Write both JUnit and UI tests.
    - Look into using Google banner ads.
    
The second Android application is a Twitter Sentiment Analysis App using the Twitter API and Watson Tone Analyzer API. This project is in an early stage so I am going to continue development from where I previously left off. Again, I am a fan of the MVP pattern so I will be using it for this project, and as I am using two rest API's I will be using Squares Retrofit library. This project will be written in Kotlin as the language is great to use and practice never hurts! 

Goals for this project:

    - Practice using Retrofit to handle rest requests.
    - To Complete a project using Kotlin 

I am sure that these two projects alone won't take the full 100 days but I have suffered from being overwelmed with too many ideas at once so this is a good start. I have lots of the recommended programming books sitting around waiting to be read as well, I started off this year with reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=kmsomers-21&linkId=436cb57537931f6473500148663f5eac">Clean Code</a><img src="//ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kmsomers-21&l=am2&o=2&a=0132350882" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> and I am currently reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B016YLTD9M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B016YLTD9M&linkCode=as2&tag=kmsomers-21&linkId=15cb2740e6fa5d7effa562190cb8f69f">The Mythical Man-month: Essays on Software Engineering</a><img src="//ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kmsomers-21&l=am2&o=2&a=B016YLTD9M" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> so I am sure that the pile will quickly wittle down throughout the challenge as well.

I don't plan on forking the git repository but I will be using Twitter throughout the 100 days so that I actually have some tweets to use when moving onto the second project. I expect my blogging and writing skills to also improve over the next 100 days so expect the style of this to change as the weeks go by!
