Today is the prep for the #100DaysOfCode challenge where I have created this site as a place for me to post my progress and make a commitment to finishing. 

100 days seems like such a long amount of time but we are already in March so I am sure that the days are going to fly by. Recently I have been starting and stopping projects without finishing them so I am going to set a couple milestones for the challenge to work towards instead of trying to think of something to spend an hour on day by day. 

I have two Android projects that are in various stages of completion which I am going to finish during the 100 days. 

The first Android application is a Never Have I Ever drinking game app that I originally started to practice using the MVP architecture pattern. It was nearly at the stage of completion but looking back through the code I originally developed it without fully understanding the pattern so I am going to rewrite it to test my knowledge of the pattern now (AND WRITE TESTS!!). The app was originally written in Java so for this project I will be sticking with Java.

Goals for this project:

    - Check that my understanding of the MVP pattern is correct.
    - To publish my first app to the play store.
    - Write both JUnit and UI tests.
    
The second Android application is a Twitter Sentiment Analysis App using the Twitter API and Watson Tone Analyzer API. This project is in an early stage so I am going to continue development from where I previously left off. Again,  I am a fan of the MVP pattern so I will be using it for this project, and as I am using two rest API's I will be using Retrofit to handle the requests. This project will also be written in Kotlin as the language is great to use and practice never hurts! 

Goals for this project:

    - Practice using Retrofit to handle rest requests.
    - To Complete a project using Kotlin 

I am sure that these two projects alone won't take the full 100 days but I have suffered from wanting to do too many things at once before which meant that nothing got done, so this is a good start. I have lots of the recommended programming books sitting around waiting to be read as well, I started off this year with reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=kmsomers-21&linkId=436cb57537931f6473500148663f5eac">Clean Code</a><img src="//ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kmsomers-21&l=am2&o=2&a=0132350882" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> and I am currently reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B016YLTD9M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B016YLTD9M&linkCode=as2&tag=kmsomers-21&linkId=15cb2740e6fa5d7effa562190cb8f69f">The Mythical Man-month: Essays on Software Engineering</a><img src="//ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kmsomers-21&l=am2&o=2&a=B016YLTD9M" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> so I am sure that the pile will quickly wittle down throughout the challenge as well.

I don't plan on forking the git repository but I will be using Twitter and Snapchat throughout the 100 days so that I actually have some tweets to use when moving onto the second project and also to motivate myself to keep going. I expect my blogging and writing skills to also improve over the next 100 days as well so I think this is enough for today.
