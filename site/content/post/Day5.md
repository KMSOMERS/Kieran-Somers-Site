Day 5. I had a phone interview for a new job today, which I passed so I'm now through to the interview stage! The interview will include logic questions and coding challenges (most likely whiteboarding) so I will need to start preparing as these kinds of problems are not my strong point. Onto today though, I'm going to carry on with the Never Have I Ever project until its complete so that I have a finished piece in my portfolio - don't want to into old habits of stopping and starting. 

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Hooked up questions activity and components to Dagger. Added a helper class for getting resources which will be mocked when it comes to testing. Wrote out the skeleton to finish the activity.

<b>Thoughts:</b> I don't think this project is going to take much longer to finish. I think the majority of the time remaining will be figuring out the play store and writing tests and as it is the weekend I hope to have it finished by the post on Sunday. A lot of time was saved as I already had the layouts figured out for this project and that is definitely my weekest area.
