Finished project <a href="https://github.com/KMSOMERS/NeverHaveIEver100DaysChallenge">here!</a>

So its already day 7 and it feels like this week has flown by. This was my first week of the challenge and I think that being held accountable with these posts is really helping me keep on track, I can't commit late or pretend to have done something as there is now a history. Today I had my first driving lesson and with the job interview coming up, things are looking positive. I also finished the first project of the challenge, meaning that I have now released my first application to the play store (well its currenly pending release). Instead of following the usual "todays progress and thoughts", I am going to break this post into positives, negatives, and thoughts I had throughout the week.

<b>Positives actions:</b>

* Went to the gym Monday - Friday, this was already a habbit but continuing while also making progress in other parts of my life is good.
* Spent an hour a day programming (or in my case I used one of the days up update my CV).
* Spent way less time on social media, I still use Snapchat and Messenger but it has really cut down my time procrastinating. 
* Had my first driving lesson and booked three more, I was a lot less nervous than I expected but the next few lessons will really show how long this process will take.
* Made some improvements in regards to my personal life.

<b>Negative actions:</b>

* I still spend too much time on Reddit and Hacker News, sometimes it feels like 'good' procrastination but it is still a time sink.
* I am currently on a break from social media (I've cut out Facebook and Instagram) and for the <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge I started using Twitter which is something I need to be careful about when it comes to wasting time. 
* I still struggle to get started, once I'm in the groove the hour (or more) flies by.

<b>Thoughts: </b> I am glad that I have started the challenge as it was the motivation needed to push through to the end of a project. I want to keep these posts about myself and the challenge so I may do a write up of the project in the future as its own post. I got a lot done this week, while a single job interview may not sound like much it is the motivation I needed to start working my way through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1118261364/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1118261364&linkCode=as2&tag=kmsomers-21&linkId=2c3b715f959802e146b1e8d148612ad6">Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job</a><img src="//ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kmsomers-21&l=am2&o=2&a=1118261364" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0984782850/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0984782850&linkCode=as2&tag=kmsomers-21&linkId=bad2ee32495e2afddd49bef2fad8c697">Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions</a><img src="//ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kmsomers-21&l=am2&o=2&a=0984782850" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> which will be beneficial for the future regardless of how this interview goes.

Overall I will say that this week was a successful week in my life, I am making progress both professionally and personally and I am excited for what the next few weeks brings.
