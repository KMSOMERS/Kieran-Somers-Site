So its already the end of week two and these small improvements are starting to add up. Right now I am focusing on my health and professional life and this commitment has kept me on track. This past week has been the start I needed with relearning algorithms and data structures and its exciting now it is beginning to make sense. Today I spent a few hours in a cafe and I think I am going to make it a regular thing to help keep the motivation strong.

Thursday is the day of my interview for a Xamarin position and while it sounds exciting, I am more excited to gain the experience of having my first real tech interview. The interview I had for my current company was not standard by any means which means I have to try harder now. Heres to continued improvement and I hope everyone's week went as well as mine.

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Read chapter 7 (Recursion) and chapter 8 (Sorting) from unsurprisingly - the book Programming Interviews Exposed. I also tackled some problems related to arrays.

<b>Thoughts:</b> I am trying to go through this book quickly to get a quick understanding of all the pieces I will eventually need to do a deep dive on, but a major benefit I am seeing already is that I am starting to understand <i>how</i> to tackle these problems, which is an issue I have had in the past. I am looking forward to starting the brain teasers section soon, as from my understanding, the up coming interview will be heavily weighed on how I solve logic based problems.
