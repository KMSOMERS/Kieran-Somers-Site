Short update today, just following a course so nothing too interesting.

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Continued with the Xamarin Android course.

<b>Thoughts:</b> As the title says - coming from a Java background C# is a similar language but has a different style. Learning to use pascal case instead of camel case and the bracket differences is definitely going to take some getting used to. One of the benefits of moving to the Xamarin platform is that I am now in a position where the only language I will be using is C# so I plan to dive as deep as possible while it is my only focus and I am sure new habits will form quickly.
