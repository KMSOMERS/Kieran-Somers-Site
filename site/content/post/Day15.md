Small update today as I am really busy. 

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Read chapter 9 (Concurrency), chapter 10 (Object-Oriented Programming) and chapter 14 (Counting, Measuring and Ordering Puzzles) from Programming Interviews Exposed. Also tackled some programming challenges.

<b>Thoughts:</b>  I am now onto the puzzles part of the book Programming Interviews Exposed. I skipped over the chapters on design patterns, databases and bit manipulation as I have experience with the first two recently (like the SQL course I took last week) and bit manipulation is a niche subject and my time is going to be better spent on relavent problems. These next couple days I will be working on puzzles / logic thinking along side programming because these will be useful skills for my interview on Thursday.
