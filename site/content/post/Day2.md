I've been really busy today so I unfortunately didn't manage to get an hour of programming in. Instead I used that time to update my CV as I have been in my current role for nearly 2 years and its crazy how much I have improved. Instead of doing a usual todays progress update ill be listing what suprised me when updating my CV and my thoughts on the process.

<b>Today's Progress:</b> I updated my CV to reflect the experience I have gained over the past 2 years. 

<b>Thoughts:</b> I'm not the best at selling myself. When I look back at the projects I have worked on at my time at Hillary's I have been able to experience multiple areas such as: 

- Java and Kotlin for application development
- Javascript with React for web development
- .Net backend
- Setup Jenkins CI

All of these are in demand skills so I need to get better at not selling myself short, its really hard to put everything down on paper.
