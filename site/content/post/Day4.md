No commits today as I just had a play around.

Its day 4 and I have already deviated from the plan. For good reason though as tomorrow I will be having a phone interview for a Xamarin role so I thought it best to spend some time looking at the framework before hand. Luckily they have offered training if I get the postition so I am excited to talk to them!

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Today I downloaded the Xamarin framework for Visual Studio and followed the getting started section on the Xamarin framework website. 

<b>Thoughts:</b> I have looked at other cross platform frameworks such as React Native and Flutter but I have always hated the way they do layouts. This was due to me being unfamiliar with CSS/HTML standards on a big project and Flutter using Dart for everything with the use of widgets. XAML while still being new feels familiar enough to the XML used in Android development so I am excited to look into this Framework further.
