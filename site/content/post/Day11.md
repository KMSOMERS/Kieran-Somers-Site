Short update again today. The SQL course I am taking at work is great and I have learnt a lot. Today I watched multiple videos on Trees since recursion is tricky to get my head around.

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Continued learning about trees and tackled exercises on Hackerrank.

<b>Thoughts:</b> Trees are starting to make more sense to me now. I am worried about getting to graphs but as long as I have a fundamental understanding of trees I should be fine. Recursion definitely makes Tree problems easier but the underlying concepts need to stick too.
