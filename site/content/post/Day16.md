Today I worked from home and it definitely blurred the line between the 100DaysOfCode challenge and just normal work. Therefore, for todays progress I'm only going to talk about the interview prep.


<b>Today's Progress:</b> Worked on logic problems as I got a bit carried away with work earlier and didn't have time for a full hour of personal programming.

<b>Thoughts:</b> Very close to the interview now and while I am not 100% confident with how much I have learnt I have still made a lot of progress. Tomorrow ill be doing a mixture of logic problems and programming challenges so that I am as prepared as possible.
