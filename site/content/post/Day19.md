These past few days have been pretty stressful but now its time to get back on it. 


<b>Today's Progress:</b> Started learning C# and started writing documentation for my current role to aid the transition after I leave.

<b>Thoughts:</b> It is a lot harder to write documentation about my role that I thought. I keep trying to think back to when I first started in my current role and what would have been beneficial to know. Currently we have no documentation so the plan right now is to get that written down before adding bits to help a new hire.
