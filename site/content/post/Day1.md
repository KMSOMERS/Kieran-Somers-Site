I am currently on a "break" form social media meaning that I have deleted Facebook and Instagram from my phone (deactivated Instagram but I use Facebook login in too many places to disable Facebook) so it definitely feels wrong to tweeting about the progress. 

Project can be found here if you want to follow the progress: <a href="https://github.com/KMSOMERS/NeverHaveIEver100DaysChallenge/tree/master">GITHUB LINK HERE</a>

Here starts the first day of the 100 days of code! I've felt pretty tired today but I still managed to spend a bit over an hour programming, go to the gym and attend a doctors appointment so it has been a productive day overall. Yesterday was about setting up the blog and that means that today was used to set up the first Android project. 

The libraries that are going to be used in this project: 

<b>Grav</b> - Taken straight from their github repository, "Grav is a library for android which allow you to make multiple animations based on points", it can create some pretty cool backgrounds.

<b>Dagger 2</b> - Dependency injection library, these small updates won't go indepth about what Dagger and dependency injection is but it fixes a lot of issues with testing in Android.

<b>Mockito</b> - Popular mocking library for testing you will see examples when it comes to unit testing the project.

<b>Today's Progress:</b> I managed to add the libraries above and write the skeleton for the project structure.

<b>Thoughts:</b> Not sure if its because I was tired but it took a lot longer than expected to set up the new project, it might be me but looking through the Dagger 2 documentation I couldn't find what the current version was as it was listed everywhere as 2.x. Reading documentation is an important skill that I need to work on though so this helped identify the issue.
