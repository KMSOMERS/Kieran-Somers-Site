Just continuing with the course. This weekend as I am having a quiet easter I plan to tackle the second project of this challenge, to create the Twitter sentiment application and what is better than using a project to learn Xamarin.

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Continued with the Xamarin Android course.

<b>Thoughts:</b> I am not too worried now about learning Xamarin Android as I am familiar with the Android lifecycle and APIs. Over the last year I have spent a lot of time learning the different design patterns in Android and I can definitely see how using a pattern such as MVP to create a Xamarin application will allow for a lot of code reuse between iOS and Android as really the different implementations should only be affecting the view layer.
