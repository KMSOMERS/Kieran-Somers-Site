Felt pretty down today so a short update as I still managed to get at least an hour of programming in. With the project nearing completion my thoughts are starting to turn towards preparation for white boarding. Tomorrow I am going to write a longer post about how I thought this week went and what I am planning to do for the next few weeks. 

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Finished the questions screen and added a banner ad so the project is now functional.

<b>Thoughts:</b> The project is very nearly complete. Last time I worked on this project I struggled with creating the assets needed to release on the play store so that will be interesting tomorrow. All thats left to do is write the tests, sign the app and then release so I am excited to finally have a completed project available on the public play store.
