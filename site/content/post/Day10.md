Already a tenth of the way through, the time has flown by. Today I unfortunately didn't have long enough to get a full hour in due to some personal stuff, however I am currently on a SQL course at work though so lots of learning today still. 

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Read chapter 5 (Trees and Graphs) from Programming Interviews Exposed.

<b>Thoughts:</b> Unfortunately didn't have time to work through problems. These two topics are incredibly important so the next couple days will be dedicated to getting a better understanding of how to work through problems involving them.
