Today I purchased a Pluralsight subscription to start learning Xamarin although if I start to struggle I may take some time to follow a course on C# instead.

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Started following a Pluralsight course on Xamarin (specifically Xamarin Android.)

<b>Thoughts:</b> The job I'm about to start uses Xamarin native for both Android and iOS so this is where I am going to focus my attention for the time being. Coming from an Android background I expect the Android development process to be familiar so thats where I am starting. I start on the 23rd of April so plenty of time to get caught up before then.
