Yesterday I released my first app to the Play store and forgot to post the link so you can find it <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.kmsomers.neverhaveiever.development">here!</a>

Its the first day of the second week and this marks the start of my interview prep. I won't have any commits to show for a while since I will be tackling problems on Leetcode and Hackerrank while reading a lot, so these posts will likely be a reflection of what I attempted for the day. Short update as I don't have much time. 

<b>Today's Progress:</b> Started reading Programming Interviews Exposed and tackled a couple problems on Leetcode.

<b>Thoughts:</b> This is going to be harder than I thought, even the easy problems on Leetcode proved challenging so I hope that I will soon look back at this day and remember how hard I used to think it was.
